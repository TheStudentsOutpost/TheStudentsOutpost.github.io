<p>A cultural emergency is being unleashed in the country, from the past few years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The plot of In the Shade of Fallen Chinar revolves around a group of young artists - students from University of Kashmir. And their tryst with regaining freedom through music, art and resistance. It talks about the factors that inspired their art and how it takes the form of resistance in the strife-torn valley’s innards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are bad time for the artists, who try to react to the existing intolerance in the country through their works.
Of the three films denied screening permission at the upcoming International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Kerala, In the Shade of Fallen Chinar, has been on YouTube for several months. Made by Fazil NC and Shawn Sebastian in June 2016, explores the music and visual arts being produced by students of the University. The chinar trees, providing the campus have provided shelter to students exchanging songs, poems, stories, photographs and ideas considered subversive by a government in denial.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Conflict is a perfect place for art,” says one of the students. Declares another, “Life is revolution.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fazil and Sebastian assemble musicians, photographers and the editor of a campus tabloid – young men and women who have only known conflict, who have been marked by personal loss, and who are deeply affected by the troubles in the Valley. A totemic fallen Chinar tree that has been converted into an art object that helps them express their feelings.
One student neatly sums up the minor efflorescence: “Nothing can happen abruptly. The youth are into escapism…not from reality but the harshness and conflict.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Shade of Fallen Chinar forms a trilogy of campus protest films, along with PN Ramachandra’s The Unbearable Being of Lightness and Kathu Lukose’s March, March, March. The Information and Broadcasting Ministry has denied the International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Kerala permission to screen the three titles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fazil has travelled to Kashmir several times, and counts many of the university students as his friends. What was initially a set of freewheeling videotaped conversations cohered into a 16-minute tribute to student resistance. The fallen ‘Chinar ka ped’, as they call it has become a metaphorical tale of how choked up the situation in Kashmir is.
Someone like them, in the 90s would’ve picked up a gun; but here they’re picking up the soul with the same ideology - to resist. And art has become an imminent emotional release, to balance your experiences, and not letting accumulate it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 16-minute film shows Kashmir as it was, before Burhan Muzzafar Wani’s death. Wani, a militant commander of Kashmir’s Hizbul Mujahideen, was killed in an encounter with security forces on July 8, 2016.
Along with the length and breadth of Kashmir that was then afflicted with remorse, University of Kashmir was closed and Mizraab, the college journal, was discontinued after two editions in June chapter.
Mizraab means a plectrum device that strikes the strings of a musical instrument known as Rabaab. And just like how a plectrum is used to stir notes of music, the fortnightly was started with the aim to stir the young, creative minds of Kashmir. The aim was to not depend on the dilapitated state’s constrained press, but to have a space that allowed them the fundamental right to ‘freedom of speech and expression.’
Brought together by the language of art, literature and music they use to communicate their resistance, these students gathered to conspire a riot — not one of violence the Valley was otherwise used to, but a more riveting one — that of their powerful voices, beautifully woven words, soulful music and vivid art.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sebastian, one of the directors of the film, says most of the students they met during the making of the film spoke of art as an avenue to vent their accumulated anger of several years. “While a section of the youth expresses through stone pelting, another section uses art to show their resistance. This film is about them,” he says.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Qazi Khytul Abyad, a 23-year-old fine arts student, gathering around the chinar was not planned. So as to not let the place seem abandoned, Abyad and other students from the nearby Faculty of Visual and Performing Arts were among the first who started gathering around the tree. Other students in the University followed suit. “Artistes gathered around the tree to sing, write and draw, and get to know each other,” she says.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Art is a universal language for everyone — irrespective of religion, language, race and nationality. Put together by their poignant hurt and love for art, gather near the Chinar — giving them hope, that maybe, their amalgamation could bring in a change that decades of uprisings have failed to.
The students’ dissent is probably not as striking as that of the ones resorting to violence. Theirs is probably just an informal, disorderly set, and from what it seems, their outbursts, their sketches or the lyrics of their songs may not be as obvious as the pellet guns or stones the others wield, but in the countless pages of history that the unrests in Kashmir has seen, theirs might make for the more vivid ones.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On similar terms, though the ranges vary - Bangalore has been facing a similar crisis, day in; day out. And, The Students’ Outpost, aims to form a faction of students’ who believe that students should emerge through the forefront, establishing concrete terms against the political situation of the country.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An open platform that will welcome thinkers, fighter and dreamers of all sorts, as we forge new solidarities, and engage critically, delving into essential dialogue, of our days. Only continual self-reflection - about our positions and fundamental freedoms, will provide us with tools to resist the system we’re complicit in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence, this event. A film screening, to involve under interest, to dialogue and discourse. Through, the aide of a film screening, and a panel discussion, that drives into, to add effect to a discussion of change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Kerala High Court on Friday, 16 June 2017, dismissed a petition by Shawn Sebastian, one of the directors of In The Shade of Fallen Chinar, against the I&amp;B ministry&#8217;s decision to withhold screening permission for the film (along with another couple of documentaries) at the 10th International Documentary and Short Film Festival, in the capital city of Kerala - Trivandrum.</p>
